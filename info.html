      <p>We know that it can be intimidating to get started, so we have created a
        walkthrough that will hopefully help you wade into the waters of making
        your idea come to life. Over the course of the Challenge, the team from
        <strong>South Bend Code School</strong> will be in place as mentors to help you hit these
        checkpoints and help you when things seem a little ambiguous or unknown.
        Take a look through the following walkthrough to get some basic ideas and
        thought process to help you get your idea going.</p>

      <h1>Mission Statement & MVP</h1>
      <img src="./images/line.svg">
      <p>So you have an idea. An INNOVATIVE idea. In order to have a better
        understanding of what you are trying to build toward, you need a mission
        statement. The mission statement is one sentence about your business that
        tells people what the core mission of your business is and helps you to
        remind yourself what the goal of your business is.</p><br>
      <p>For example, if I had an idea for a dog walking business, my mission
        statement might be: <strong>"We help busy pet owners by taking their dogs
        for walks."</strong> This sets an expectation for what my business does.
        Note that it isn't an elevator pitch. It is only one sentence long. That
        is all it needs to be. When starting up a new idea, you have to keep things
        simple and to the point. Don't try to hash out all of the details. Just
        know the mission.</p><br>
      <p>This brings up the next thing we need to be aware of, <strong>MVP</strong>. MVP stands
        for Minimum Viable Product. Minimum Viable Product is the lowest function
        version of your product that you need in order to be successfully taking
        customers, turning profit, or lifting your business off the ground. When
        starting something new, it is easy to go idea crazy and create a bunch
        of extra features to your product that won't actually help you take steps
        forward toward bringing this idea to life. MVP helps to steer you clear of
        some of those added features that might not be important right now.</p><br>
      <p>Having a mission statement helps us to stick to a minimum viable product.
        You know that you aren't going to take cats for walks because your mission
        is only to take dogs for walks, not cats. You know that you are going to
        dog sit over weekends because your mission is to take dogs for walks, not
        watch them over the weekend. You know you aren't going to pick up food for
        people's pets because your mission is to take dogs for walks, not keep their
        food stock full.</p><br>
      <p>Now we know what the true mission of our business or idea is!</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div id="customer" class="row walkthruSection"><a href="customer"></a>
    <div class="col-md-4 col-md-offset-2">
      <h1>Customer Identification and Validation</h1>
      <img src="./images/line.svg">
      <p>Now that we have a mission statement and a clear idea of what our goal
        is. We need to check and make sure that there is actually a need for our
        idea. It is easy to get scared by this part of the process. A lot of folks
        don't want to go share their idea with anyone because they think that
        people will shoot it down and say that it isn't a good idea at all. It
        is completely reasonable to be scared by this. You are putting yourself
        out there by sharing your idea with others. Rejection is hard! Don't have
        high school prom flashbacks just yet.</p><br>
      <p>This situation is very different:</p><br>
      <p><strong>Prom: Guy asks girl to prom - she says no - guy goes home sad
        and dejected and eats three tubs of double chocolate fudge ice cream
        because he feels like his life is over.</strong></p><br>
      <p><strong>Customer Validation: Girl goes and asks someone if they think
        they would use her business or innovation - potential customer says no -
        girl asks more questions about why that customer wouldn't use the idea -
        customer provides more feedback - girl does one of two things: 1) Goes
        home and tweaks the idea so that the potential customer does find it
        valuable. 2) Realizes the person she is talking to is not actually her
        ideal customer and finds a different customer demographic to ask about
        her idea. - After adjusting, girl goes on to launch a very successful
        business and lives happily ever after.</strong></p><br>
      <p>You need to be okay with putting your idea out there, have an understanding
        that not everyone is going to respond positively to your idea. THAT IS OKAY.
        Keep moving forward, keep collecting feedback, keep adjusting. In the end,
        you'll find something that you think people will use or buy.</p><br>

      <p><strong>Using the dog walking example from earlier:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>I interviewed 40 people.
        </li>
        <li>In the first round of interviews, 8 people said they would use my service. However, 30 people said that the service would be much more valuable to them if I also picked up dog food for their pet a couple of times per month.
        </li>
        <li>I adjust my mission statement to be, "We help busy pet owners by taking their dogs for walks and making sure their dog food supply is full."
        </li>
        <li>With my new mission statement and business idea, I know approximately 75% of the dog owners I spoke with would use my business.
        </li>
        <li>Now I can move forward with a validated idea.
        </li>
      </ul><br>

      <p>There is no right number of people to ask about your product. It is helpful
        if you have more than 10, but you don't necessarily need 50 or 100. You
        want to check in and make sure there is potential, but at some point you
        need to stop pounding pavement and actually need to bring your idea to life.</p>

      <h1>Business Process</h1>
      <p>Understanding the process of your business or the process of how your
        idea is used or consumed by users is critical to bringing it to life. It
        helps to make a drawing or write out the process by which your "thing"
        is consumed.</p>

      <p><strong>Continuing on with the dog service we spoke of earlier:</strong></p>

      <ul>
        <li>Potential customers hear about me on facebook or the local news.</li>
        <li>Those people go to my website.</li>
        <li>They fill out the info I need about them and their dogs.</li>
        <li>Someone from my side of the business emails them and sends them the
          dates and times that someone will be by to walk their dog, along with
          the dates dog food will be picked up each month.</li>
        <li>The method of payment also has to be identified. Does the customer
          pay in cash, check, or online checkout? How am I going to handle payment?</li>
        <li>Someone then has to go to that customer's house during those times
          and execute those tasks.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If I can map all of this out, it is extremely helpful to anyone I hire
        to do any work for my company. It is also extremely helpful to help me
        to understand how my business is going to operate and what any unique
        challenges might present themselves. I might conclude that a unique
        challenge from the process above is going to be scheduling. The number
        of dogs I can walk is going to be critical to my business. How can I plan
        accordingly?</p>

      <p><strong>Understanding the process helps you to know more about your business.</strong></p>

      <h1>Wireframing</h1>
      <p>If your idea is one that consists of an application, website, or some
        sort of digital interface, it is best to wireframe out what the interface
        will look like. Wireframing is a process where you actually draw an outline
        of how each screen of your application looks. It is immensely helpful to
        do this not only for you, but for any developers who might be working on
        your application.</p><br>

      <p>There are many online tools to help you wireframe out your application,
        but this can be done very simply with paper and pencil.</p><br>

      <p><strong>Let's use our dog care idea as an example of what a wireframe might look like:</strong></p>
